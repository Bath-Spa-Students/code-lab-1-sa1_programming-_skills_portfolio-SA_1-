"""In this exercise, you’ll create a program that stores and prints your name, hometown, and age to the console using a Python dictionary.
Steps:
1. Store the information (name, hometown, and age) as key-value pairs in a
dictionary.
2. Print the values on separate lines using a single print() statement.
3. Use variables with appropriate data types for each piece of information.
"""

name = ("muhammad munim")
hometown = ("larkana")
age = ("18")
print("name:" , name , "hometown:" , hometown , "age;", age )

#Assign the string "Muhammad munim" to the variable codename
#Codename – Muhammad munim

#That is why we will use the string “Larkana” when defining the variable of hometown.

#Now set the string “18” to the desired variable, let’s assign it to the variable “age”.

#Using the codenames print their home town and age
