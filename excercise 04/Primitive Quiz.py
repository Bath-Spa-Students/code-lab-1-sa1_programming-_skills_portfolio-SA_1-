"""In this exercise, you’ll create a simple program that asks the user a question,
evaluates their answer, and provides feedback.
Steps:
1. Write a program that asks the user “What is the capital of France?” and
waits for their response.
2. If the user’s answer is correct (i.e., “Paris”), the program should print a
message saying the answer is correct.
3. If the answer is incorrect, the program should print a message saying the
answer is wrong.

else:
    print("incorrect")
    

#Saves the question text in the variable called question.

#Learns from the user what the question is by using the present question.

#Takes a check in the format of an array, and compares the user answer with “Qabool” or “qabool”.

#If the answer matches prints “correct”.

#Performs the following line if the answer doesn’t match.
