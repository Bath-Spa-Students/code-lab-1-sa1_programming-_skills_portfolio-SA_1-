"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.
Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console
"""
y = 8
x = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

#Give y the value 8
#Let x be equal to 10
#Store the sum of x and y in variable z
#The expected result z is 18
